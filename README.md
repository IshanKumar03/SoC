# SoC
In this project I used how to create a basic website using HTML and CSS.I have benn learning the syntax of HTML and CSS and came to know that HTML is used to write content in a webpage and CSS is used for styling it.
I also learnt various things about Javascript.I learnt that JavaScript enables event-driven programming, where functions are executed in response to events occurring on the webpage, like mouse clicks or keyboard inputs.
 JavaScript supports the creation of reusable code blocks called functions. Functions can take parameters, perform operations, and return values.
 JavaScript includes conditional statements such as if-else and switch for executing code based on certain conditions. It also has looping structures like for and while for repeating code blocks.
 Then We compared react and angular and this is what i learned in it
 React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It focuses on building user interfaces (UIs) and follows a component-based architecture.
React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and render UI components. It updates only the necessary parts of the UI, resulting in improved performance.
React emphasizes a "one-way" data flow, where data flows from parent components to child components. It promotes a unidirectional flow of data, making the application easier to understand and debug.
Angular is a full-fledged, opinionated JavaScript framework developed by Google. It provides a complete solution for building large-scale applications.
Angular follows a modular and component-based architecture, similar to React. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for building complex applications.
Angular uses a two-way data binding approach, where changes in the UI automatically update the underlying data model, and vice versa. This can simplify certain aspects of development but may introduce additional complexity
